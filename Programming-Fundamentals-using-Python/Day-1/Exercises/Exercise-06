The below program will draw a circle and a rectangle. Run and observe the result.
Change the radius of the circle and the width, height of the rectangle using the given controls and run to observe the changes.

Your objective is to create and submit the canvas where radius of circle is 60, width of rectangle is 4 times the radius and height of the rectangle is 1 / 2 of radius.


radius = 60, width = 240, height = 30
import turtle                 # allows us to use the turtles library

wn = turtle.Screen()     # creates a graphics window
wn.setup(500,440)      # set window dimension

circle_rad=60              # set the radius
rectangle_width=240   # set the width
rectangle_height=30   # set the height

alex = turtle.Turtle()   # create a turtle named alex
alex.shape("turtle")    # alex looks like a turtle
alex.color('red')         # alex has a color
alex.circle(circle_rad)
alex.backward(rectangle_width/2)
alex.forward(rectangle_width)
alex.right(90)
alex.forward(rectangle_height)
alex.right(90)
alex.forward(rectangle_width)
alex.right(90)
alex.forward(rectangle_height)
