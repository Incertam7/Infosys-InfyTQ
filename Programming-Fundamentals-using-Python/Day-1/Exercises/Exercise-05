Write a pseudo-code to calculate the factorial of a given number.
Example: factorial of 5 = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.
Note 1: Factorial of 0 is 1.
Note 2: You can drag and drop the required number of pseudo-code magnets into the pseudo-code box.




    Pseudo-code
    input Number
    Factorial=1
    if(Number==0) then
    Factorial=1
    else
    while(Number!=0) do
    Factorial=Factorial*Number
    Number=Number-1
    end-while
    end-if
    display Factorial
