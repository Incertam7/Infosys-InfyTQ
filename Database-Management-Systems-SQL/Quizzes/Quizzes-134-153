137
Consider a relation R(A, B, C, D) with the following functional dependencies: A -> (B, C, D), (A, D) -> (B, C) and 
(C, D) -> (A, B).
Identify the candidate key(s).
	{A}, {C, D}



138
A -> B also means that B -> A. State if the statement is True or False.
	False



139
The database design prevents some data from being stored due to _______.
	Insertion anomalies



140
A relation is in 2NF if:
	All of the above.
	
	(All the values of non-key attributes are dependent fully on the candidate key.
	Any non-key attribute that are dependent on only part of the candidate key should be moved to another relation where the partial key is the actual full key.
	It must be already in the 1NF.)



141
If one attribute is determinant of second, which in turn is determinant of third, then the relation cannot be:
	3NF



142

IDX2 – BANK_ACCT, PAY_AMT
IDX3 – INIT_NAME, PAY_DT
Which of the following queries will result in UNIQUE INDEX SCAN?

151
LightWorks is a consumer appliance company. They have their products stored in the table named ConsumerProducts that has the following attributes. ProductId, ProductName, ProductCategory, ProductPrice, ProductAvailability. ProductId is the primary key. Also for faster search and retrieval of data there are indexes IXPN on ProductName and IXPC on ProductCategory.

John and Piper are discussing performance of the LightWorks database and are having an argument. John says "If I write a query SELECT DISTINCT ProductCategory FROM ConsumerProducts WHERE LENGTH(ProductName) > 5 then the index IXPN will not be used while IXPC will be used" Piper says "John you are wrong!, IXPN will be used and not IXPC for your scenario" Who is right and who is wrong?
	
	Both John and Piper are wrong
