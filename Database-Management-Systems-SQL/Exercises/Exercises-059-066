					SELECT SD.saleid AS saleid, SD.prodid AS prodid, SD.quantity AS qty, SD.quantity * (P.price - P.discount/100) AS saleamt
					FROM SaleDetail SD
					INNER JOIN Product P ON P.prodid = SD.prodid
					ORDER BY saleid

						this gives us the sale amount of each product in each sale id, next we need to find the total sale amount of each saleid

					SELECT saleid, SUM(saleamt) AS totalsale
					FROM 
						(SELECT SD.saleid AS saleid, SD.prodid AS prodid, SD.quantity AS qty, SD.quantity * (P.price - P.discount/100) AS saleamt
						FROM SaleDetail SD
						INNER JOIN Product P ON P.prodid = SD.prodid)
					GROUP BY saleid
					ORDER BY saleid

						this gives us the total sale amount for each saleid

					SELECT AVG(totalsale)
					FROM (SELECT saleid, SUM(saleamt) AS totalsale
					FROM 
						(SELECT SD.saleid AS saleid, SD.prodid AS prodid, SD.quantity AS qty, SD.quantity * (P.price - P.discount/100) AS saleamt
						FROM SaleDetail SD
						INNER JOIN Product P ON P.prodid = SD.prodid)
					GROUP BY saleid)

						this gives us the average of the saleamt of all saleid

					SELECT SM.sid AS sid, SM.sname AS sname, S.saleid AS saleid, SD.prodid AS prodid, SD.quantity AS qty, SD.quantity * (P.price - P.discount/100) AS saleamt
					FROM Salesman SM
					INNER JOIN Sale S ON SM.sid = S.sid
					INNER JOIN SaleDetail SD ON SD.saleid = S.saleid
					INNER JOIN Product P ON SD.prodid = P.prodid
					ORDER BY SM.sid

						this joins the salesman to their corresponding sales id and the products they sold, and the sale amount of each product
						now we group the salesmen together and add up their individual sales

					SELECT sid, sname, SUM(saleamt) AS totalsales
					FROM
						(SELECT SM.sid AS sid, SM.sname AS sname, S.saleid AS saleid, SD.prodid AS prodid, SD.quantity AS qty, SD.quantity * (P.price - P.discount/100) AS saleamt
						FROM Salesman SM
						INNER JOIN Sale S ON SM.sid = S.sid
						INNER JOIN SaleDetail SD ON SD.saleid = S.saleid
						INNER JOIN Product P ON SD.prodid = P.prodid)
					GROUP BY sid, sname
					ORDER BY sid

						this has grouped each salesman to their individual sales amount, now we calculate the average of these saleamt and filter out salesman who have salesamt larger than this average

					SELECT AVG(totalsales)
					FROM (SELECT sid, sname, SUM(saleamt) AS totalsales
					FROM (SELECT SM.sid AS sid, SM.sname AS sname, S.saleid AS saleid, SD.prodid AS prodid, SD.quantity AS qty, SD.quantity * (P.price - P.discount/100) AS saleamt
					FROM Salesman SM
					INNER JOIN Sale S ON SM.sid = S.sid
					INNER JOIN SaleDetail SD ON SD.saleid = S.saleid
					INNER JOIN Product P ON SD.prodid = P.prodid)
					GROUP BY sid, sname)

						this is the average value
						now we display sid, sname and location of the salesman whose total sales is greater than this value
