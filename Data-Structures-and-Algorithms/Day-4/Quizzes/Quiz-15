The following values are to be stored in a hash table (arriving in the order shown) using the hash function, h(k) = k % 5.
81, 20, 34, 42, 21, 45
Assume that the hash values are stored in ascending order.
Identify whether collision will occur while mapping the values using the hash function.



Collision will occur at position 0,1
