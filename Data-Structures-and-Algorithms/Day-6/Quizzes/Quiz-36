Fenny has come up with 4 different algorithms with different step-counts as shown below to solve a problem.
Which of the following have the same Big-O complexity?

Step count for Algorithm1 : n^2 + n
Step count for Algorithm2 : n^2 + 5*n^2 + logn
Step count for Algorithm3 : n^2 + 2^n
Step count for Algorithm4 : nlogn + 2^n + n!
